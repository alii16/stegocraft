**Unlock the secrets hidden in plain sight with StegoCraft!** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîí

StegoCraft is a cutting-edge web tool that empowers you to embed and extract sensitive information within seemingly ordinary files using advanced steganography techniques. Whether you need to discreetly share confidential documents or securely store personal data, StegoCraft offers a user-friendly and robust solution.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Hide Data:** Seamlessly embed files (any type!) and text messages within various carrier files like images, audio, and video.
* **Extract Data:** Effortlessly retrieve hidden files and messages from steganographic files.
* **Encryption:** Add an extra layer of security by encrypting your secret data with a password before embedding it.
* **Real-time Preview:** Get a sneak peek of supported extracted file types (images, audio, video) directly in your browser.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-navigate design for users of all technical levels.
* **Light and Fast:** Built with modern web technologies for a smooth and responsive experience.
* **Dark Mode Support:** Enjoy a comfortable experience in any environment with built-in dark mode.
* **Other Handy Tools:** Includes links to useful external tools like AES File Encryption, Password Generator, and more!

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

StegoCraft utilizes sophisticated algorithms to subtly alter the carrier file in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye or ear, allowing you to conceal your secret data effectively. When extracting, the tool reverses this process to reveal the hidden information.

For encrypted data, StegoCraft employs a robust XOR encryption method (after Base64 encoding) to ensure that only those with the correct password can access the hidden content.
